Privacy Preserving Donations for Non-Profits
============================================

- _Coordinator:_ Paige Peterson paige@z.cash

- _Forums:_ 
  This working group currently takes place in the main channel chat.zcashcommunity.com/#the-zcash-foundation

- _Statement of purpose:_
  The mission of this working group is to help non-profits to accepting privacy-preserving donations. This can mean both privacy for the donors, who may wish to donate anonymously, and privacy for the non-profits, who may wish to only disclose the details of donations to select third-parties.
 
  More specific tasks include:
  - Outreach to non-profits to help them understand the benefits of cryptocurrency donations and their security/privacy implications 
  - Provide support and guidance to non-profits to help them set up and operate their donations
  - Prepare documentation and “starter guides” to facilitate the above
 
  So far, we have already helped several non-profits to begin accepting Zcash donations:
  - Courage Foundation https://couragefound.org/donate/
  - Internet Archive https://forum.z.cash/t/internet-archive-accepting-zcash-donations/15986
  - Torservers.net https://www.torservers.net/donate.html#cryptocurrencies
  - riseup.net https://riseup.net/en/donate#zcash
  - Several more are upcoming!
