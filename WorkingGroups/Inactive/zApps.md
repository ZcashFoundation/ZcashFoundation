zApps Working Group
==========================

- *Coordinator:* Josh Cincinnati (interim coordinator)

- *Forums:* This working group will initially begin as a scheduled Hangout among participants, but will eventually include a chat room on chat.zcashcommunity.com and IRL meetings/presentations as well.

- *Statement of Purpose:* Pursuant to [issue 28](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/28) and [issue 35](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/35), there are many projects—blockchain related and beyond—that are potentially integrating zeroknowledge proofs and processes. To paraphrase [@nathan-at-least](https://github.com/nathan-at-least), this is a newly emerging technical field without well-established techniques, and it stands to reason that a working group could help standardize efforts, hasten development, and improve security across implementations.

- *Mailing List:* [zapps-wg](https://lists.z.cash.foundation/mailman/listinfo/zapps-wg)

Next Steps:
  - Assemble list of potential participants and directly reach out. The current outreach list includes:
    - Filecoin
    - Ethereum
    - Chronicled
    - QED-it
    - Tezos
    - Quorum
    - Zcash Company
    - Libsnark
  - Schedule Hangout, including a small presentation by the Zcash Company to describe their latest work and to collect feedback from other participants
  - Initiate other channels for discussion (chat.zcashcommunity.com) and highlight opportunities for mutual development.
  - IRL presentation by working group at a large venue (Devcon/meetup?)

Long Term Goal: In addition to fostering cooperation between many supporters and researchers behind zeroknowledge systems, the group would publish reports on their findings...and eventually offer services to other developers/researchers who want to build their own zeroknowledge applications (hence the *zApp* moniker).
