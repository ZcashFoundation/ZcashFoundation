Zcash Miners Working Group
==========================

- _Coordinator:_ Gibson Ashpool aka mineZcash minezcash@gmail.com

- _Forums:_ This working group will start with a channel on Zcash community chat but may progress to an additional platform depending on how we decide to poll.

- _Statement of Purpose:_ This working group is intended to gather feedback and foster an open dialog from the overall mining community about what Zcash protocol priorities they may find important and try to provide a voice for the various mining groups and pools. With upcoming Forks and possible changes to Equilhash parameters it will be important to gather feedback about how miners may be affected. 

 First steps:
 - Open a public channel on the Chat to be called ZcashMinersOrg
 - Compile a list of the 10 largest mining pools by zcha.in share size 
 - Compile contact information about operators of those pools and invite them to join the chat group
 - Discuss what this group is about and if there are any immediate concerns or particular pain points that may need to be addressed with the way they operate and use Zcash? Are there any suggestions for improvement?
Later Steps:
 - Decide upon a good method for gathering majority opinion of possible polarizing topics: 
    - For minor issues this could be something as simple as a private web-based voting tool with only verified voters 
    - For major (protocol changing) issues: something as complex as a possible staking system like Andrew Miller has mentioned on the chat: https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/the-zcash-foundation?msg=rsERpmr275LwMFPFT But as mentioned in that thread, there may not be a technically feasible way to do a proof-or-staking voting system in Zcash. 
    
    There are existing Zcash voting proposals such as Zcash issue #1112 and #2321 that should also be taken into consideration and possibly leveraged.
